# Testing Story Coverage

**Status:** In progress

**Goal:** Maintain story-linked verification across all plan collections.

## Why This Plan Exists

This plan exists because stories, tests, and completion claims drift easily unless coverage is maintained continuously. The repository rules require story-linked verification rather than endpoint-count or ad hoc test accumulation.

## Scope

- BDD story inventory
- Story-to-test-layer mapping
- Per-plan coverage status and deferrals
- Coverage expectations for page flow, E2E, contract, integration, runtime, and golden tests

## Development Constraints

- [testing-strategy.md](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/core/testing-strategy.md)
- [product-definition.md](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/core/product-definition.md)
- [bdd-user-stories.md](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/testing/bdd-user-stories.md)

## Required Test Layers

- `Domain Unit`
- `Application Integration`
- `Transport Contract`
- `Async Runtime`
- `Frontend Unit`
- `Frontend Feature`
- `Frontend Page Flow`
- `E2E`
- `Public Contract Golden`

## Rules

- Formal API behavior requires contract coverage
- Public contract output requires golden coverage
- Job/projector/delivery behavior requires runtime coverage
- Formal page families require page-flow coverage
- High-value paths require E2E coverage

## Ongoing Acceptance Criteria

- Each plan records covered stories, missing stories, and approved deferrals
- Page-flow and E2E gaps required by `docs/core/testing-strategy.md` remain visible until closed
- Story coverage is updated at the start and end of each major plan

## Stage 2 Membership / Catalog Evidence Notes

- Story `6` currently has explicit evidence on the implemented workspace-members plus invite-status/joined slice: domain lifecycle tests in `apps/backend/internal/membership/domain/workspace_member_test.go`, application integration tests in `apps/backend/internal/membership/application/workspace_members_test.go`, generated transport-contract route tests in `apps/backend/internal/http/web_workspace_members_generated_test.go`, Web page-flow coverage in `apps/website/src/pages/members/__tests__/workspace-members-page-flow.test.tsx` and `apps/website/src/pages/members/__tests__/invite-status-joined-page-flow.test.tsx`, and joined-page URL-state unit coverage in `apps/website/src/shared/url-state/__tests__/invite-status-location.test.ts`.
- Story `3A` currently has formal Web page-flow evidence for `projects`, `clients`, and `tags`, plus partial transport-contract coverage for generated project/client/tag routes. This is still partial because `tasks`, deeper CRUD surface, and stats/templates/periods behavior are not yet covered as required by the product plan.
- Story `7` currently has partial evidence from `apps/backend/internal/catalog/domain/project_access_test.go` plus the existing `projects` page flow. This only covers part of the documented private-project visibility/mutability rules and does not yet close reports/webhooks/runtime propagation.
- Story `7A` currently has page-flow evidence on the `groups` page only; backend contract and group-membership semantics remain open.
- Story `7B` currently has backend route-integration evidence in `apps/backend/internal/http/web_workspace_permissions_flow_test.go`, permission-config page-flow evidence in `apps/website/src/pages/permission-config/__tests__/permission-config-page-flow.test.tsx`, and direct real-runtime save/reload evidence in `apps/website/e2e/permission-config.real-runtime.spec.ts`. Transport-contract coverage and finer-grained permission semantics remain open.
- Story `6A` remains unimplemented in the current formal surface, so no coverage is claimed.

## Stage 2 Page-Flow / E2E Gap Register

- `timer` page family (`calendar | list | timesheet`) still lacks required page-flow and E2E closure; owner: [Tracking Core Transactions](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/product/tracking-core-transactions.md).
- `integrations webhooks` page family still lacks formal page-flow and E2E coverage; owner: [Webhooks Runtime](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/product/webhooks-runtime.md).
- `profile` and `settings` still lack direct E2E per-page closure; owner: [UI and Figma Parity Baseline](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/foundation/ui-and-figma-parity-baseline.md).
- `projects`/`clients`/`tags`/`groups` page families have current page-flow evidence but still miss direct E2E closure and, where applicable, matching backend contract depth; owner: [Membership, Access, and Catalog](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/product/membership-access-and-catalog.md).
- `permissions` now has direct real-runtime E2E plus backend route-integration evidence, but it still lacks matching transport-contract coverage and finer-grained permission-rule enforcement; owner: [Membership, Access, and Catalog](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/product/membership-access-and-catalog.md).
- `workspace members` and `invite-status/joined` have current page-flow coverage for the implemented member lifecycle closure but still miss direct E2E; owner: [Membership, Access, and Catalog](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/product/membership-access-and-catalog.md).
- `auth logout` and protected-route guard path still lacks formal page-flow and E2E closure; owner: [One-Way Structure Governance](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/plan/foundation/one-way-structure-governance.md).

## Current Drift Against Docs

- Several active plan collections still summarize evidence without a full story-to-test-layer mapping required by [testing-strategy.md](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/core/testing-strategy.md)
- The story inventory in [bdd-user-stories.md](/Users/ctrdh/Code/opentoggl/docs/testing/bdd-user-stories.md) still contains partially covered flows that should gate completion more explicitly
