    {
      question: "Can it replace Toggl Track?",
      answer:
        "Yes. OpenToggl is compatible with Toggl's Track, Reports, and Webhooks APIs. If your tools talk to Toggl via its API, they should work with OpenToggl without changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bring my Toggl data?",
      answer: "Yes. You can import Toggl export files — your history comes with you.",

    {
      question: "What do I need to self-host?",
      answer:
        "Docker. One docker compose up -d brings up the full stack (Go backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL). We also have guides for Synology, CasaOS, and fnOS.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are hosted and self-hosted the same?",
      answer: "Yes. Same code, same features. No premium tier, no feature gating.",

    {
      question: "Why AI-friendly?",
      answer:
        "Stable API, solid docs, self-hostable. Agents and scripts can integrate without third-party rate limits getting in the way.",
